#Create a new python script and add the following lines to it:

def main():
  pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()

#Add a comment to briefly explain what this boilerplate code is doing.

#def main()::

#This defines a function named main.

#The pass statement is a placeholder that does nothing. It is used here because the function body is empty. You would replace pass with the actual code you want to run when the script is executed.

#if __name__ == "__main__"::

##This is a conditional statement that checks whether the script is being run directly or imported as a module.

#__name__ is a special built-in variable in Python:

#When the script is run directly, __name__ is set to "__main__".

#When the script is imported as a module, __name__ is set to the name of the module (e.g., the filename without the .py extension).
